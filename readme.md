This code written on MASM under intel processor for Microsoft Windows based laptops, that perform such logic:
- User input PIN code that compromise with 5 position(5 digits)
- Each other position has some range if range incorrect then PIN code is invalid else valid PIN

This implementation uses finite state machine to sort through range each other position
